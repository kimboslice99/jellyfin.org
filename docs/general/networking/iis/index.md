# IIS

"[Internet Information Services](https://www.iis.net) is an extensible web server software created by Microsoft for use with the Windows NT family. IIS supports HTTP, HTTP/2, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SMTP and NNTP. It has been an integral part of the Windows NT family since Windows NT 4.0" - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services)

There are two methods of configuration for IIS
- [ARR configuration](reverseproxy) (easier)
- [ANCM configuration](ancm) (faster, though technically unsupported by the JF team.)
